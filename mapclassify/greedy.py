    Color GeoDataFrame using various strategies of greedy (topological) colouring.

    Attempts to color a GeoDataFrame using as few colors as possible, where no
    neighbours can have same color as the feature itself. Offers various strategies
    ported from QGIS or implemented within networkX for greedy graph coloring.

    ``greedy`` will return pandas.Series representing assinged color codes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    gdf : GeoDataFrame
        GeoDataFrame
    strategy : str (default 'balanced')
        Determine coloring strategy. Options are ``'balanced'`` for algorithm based on
        QGIS Topological coloring. It is aiming for a visual balance, defined by the
        balance parameter.

        Other options are those supported by networkx.greedy_color:

        * ``'largest_first'``
        * ``'random_sequential'``
        * ``'smallest_last'``
        * ``'independent_set'``
        * ``'connected_sequential_bfs'``
        * ``'connected_sequential_dfs'``
        * ``'connected_sequential'`` (alias for the previous strategy)
        * ``'saturation_largest_first'``
        * ``'DSATUR'`` (alias for the previous strategy)

        For details see
        https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/
        generated/networkx.algorithms.coloring.greedy_color.html

    balance : str (default 'count')
        If strategy is ``'balanced'``, determine the method of color balancing.

        * ``'count'`` attempts to balance the number of features per each color.
        * ``'area'`` attempts to balance the area covered by each color.
        * ``'centroid'`` attempts to balance the distance between colors based
            on the distance between centroids.
        * ``'distance'`` attempts to balance the distance between colors based
            on the distance between geometries. Slower than ``'centroid'``,
            but more precise.

        ``'centroid'`` and ``'distance'`` are significantly slower than other
        especially for larger GeoDataFrames.

        Apart from ``'count'``, all require CRS to be projected (not in degrees)
        to ensure metric values are correct.

    min_colors: int (default 4)
        If strategy is ``'balanced'``, define the minimal number of colors to be used.

    sw : 'queen', 'rook' or libpysal.weights.W (default 'queen')
        If min_distance is None, one can pass ``'libpysal.weights.W'``
        object denoting neighbors or let greedy to generate one based on
        `'queen'`` or ``'rook'`` contiguity.

    min_distance : float
        Set minimal distance between colors.

        If min_distance is not None, slower algorithm for generating
        spatial weghts is used based on intersection between geometries.
        ``'min_distance'`` is then used as a tolerance of intersection.

    silence_warnings : bool (default True)
        Silence libpysal warnings when creating spatial weights.

    interchange : bool (defaul False)
        Use the color interchange algorithm (applicable for networkx strategies)

        https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/
        generated/networkx.algorithms.coloring.greedy_color.html

    1    0
    2    0
    3    1
    4    4

    >>> africa["balanced_area"].head()
    0    1
    1    2
    2    0
    3    1
    4    3
    Name: balanced_area, dtype: int64

    Using rook adjacency:

    >>> africa["rook_adjacency"] = greedy(africa, sw="rook")
    >>> africa["rook_adjacency"].tail()
    46    3
    47    0
    48    2
    49    3
    50    1
    Name: rook_adjacency, dtype: int64

    Adding minimal distance between colors:

    >>> africa["min_distance"] = greedy(africa, min_distance=1000000)
    >>> africa["min_distance"].head()
    0    1
    1    8
    2    0
    3    7
    4    4
    Name: min_distance, dtype: int64

    Using different coloring strategy:

    >>> africa["smallest_last"] = greedy(africa, strategy="smallest_last")
    >>> africa["smallest_last"].head()
    0    3
    1    1
    2    1

    4    1
